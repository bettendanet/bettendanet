- 👋 Hi, I’m @bettendone and i have lost 3 Github accounts already :< (but btw you can say me bettendanet)
- 👀 I’m interested in learn a lot of coding and make some games... maybe some 3d modeling
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code on C++, Java and also on using on Godot
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate with @Piratesoftware(the twitch streamer) but that's impossible practically. I think it will never happen sadly
- 📫 How to reach me is on twitter @bettendone (yep the only one)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I speak spanish but i talk with myself on english so... is weird i know

And btw, what are you doing reading this? Go to play or learn something new! (or study for school or college if you need to)
